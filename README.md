# OneStop_Notifications

## Developer Getting Started
- git clone https://github.com/aggie-coding-club/OneStop_Notifications.git

## Starting up current version
- <code>git pull</code> everytime you start developing
- <code>npm install</code>
- <code>npm start</code>


## Testing
We are using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) for testing. All tests are in the <code>project/tests/</code> directory.

I highly recommend getting [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) for further testing of the API.
